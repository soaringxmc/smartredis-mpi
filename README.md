# SmartRedis-MPI

A communication library bridging parallel CFD solvers and Redis databases.

## Overview

SmartRedis-MPI provides subroutines that facilitate communication between Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solvers and Redis databases. Built on top of the SmartRedis library and Message Passing Interface (MPI), this library simplifies the process of storing and retrieving data from Redis databases in parallel computing environments.

## Key Features

- **Simplified Integration**: Add just a few lines of code to enable communication between any parallel CFD solver and Redis database
- **SmartRedis and MPI**: Designed for high-performance parallel computing environments
- **Production-Ready**: Currently used in real-world applications while continuing to evolve

## Applications

SmartRedis-MPI has been actively used by [SmartFlow](https://github.com/soaringxmc/SmartFlow) with [CaLES](https://github.com/soaringxmc/CaLES) as the CFD solver for deep reinforcement learning of turbulence modeling and flow control. 

In general, its applications include:

- Deep reinforcement learning for turbulence modeling
- Deep reinforcement learning for flow control systems
- Other application of machine learning to computational fluid dynamics


## Status

The library is functional and in active use. Development is ongoing to implement additional features and improve the code structure.
